      <p className="text-base text-center">
        The Office of Off-Campus Student Life serves as a vital resource for students living off-campus, providing support, programs, and services to enhance the off-campus living experience. This office works to connect off-campus students with campus resources, facilitate community building, and ensure student safety and well-being in off-campus environments. Through various initiatives and programs, the office aims to bridge the gap between on-campus and off-campus student experiences, fostering a sense of belonging and engagement for all students regardless of their housing situation.
